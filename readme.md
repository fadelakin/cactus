# Cactus

Cactus is a super lightweight text editor I made in C. It supports syntax highlighting for .c and .cpp files.

## FAQ

*Should I use this*

No. It actually doesn't work all that well. You can write in it, but as far as I know, there is no indentation.

Saving files does not actually work either. Also there are so many bugs.

*What if I just want to run it and see*

Okay cool. So if you have C compiler, just make all with the makefile and then use `./cactus` to run the editor.

If you have a C or C++ file that you want to open with the editor, run `./cactus file_name.c` or whatever.

I just wanted to see try to see if I could get somewhere and I think I did. This is all command line based.
